## Threaded Revo Nozzle Holder

6 Files. 2 clip in. One clips in perpendicular to the slot, the other parelell to the slot. The other 4 can be mounted with T-nuts or hammer nuts. There are M4 and M5 versions with the mounting holes on left or right.

I print the with the large hole on the build plate. Bottom down should also work. I do not know if the threads will print useably if the part is printed on its side.
